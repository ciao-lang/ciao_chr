        original KU Leuven CHR system developed and maintained by
          T. Schrijvers.  CHR is a commited-choice constraint language with
          which it is easy to model advanced constraint systems and general
          algorithms.  The seminal description of CHR can be found in
          @cite{Fruehwirth98}.  Many examples and material on extensions and
          applications of CHR can be found at
          @tt{http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/~dtai/projects/CHR/}.  The homepage of
          this CHR implementation is
